### About .vimrc : 
If you are a new vim user, then you can also use [Vim Bootstrap](http://vim-bootstrap.com/) to generate your vimrc. Which will help you generate common configurations for your vim or you can use this one.

To manage my vim plugins I am using [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug). There are many other plugin managers out there. such as ([Vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim), [Pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen)).
